    <p>I am an empirical economist with research interests in urban economics, labour economics, and economic history.
        My research has touched on several subfields of economics, including migration, agglomeration of economics
        activity, peer effects, knowledge spillovers. I use novel, historical datasets to study the migration and
        geographic clustering of creative workers and to identify agglomeration effects associated with these creative
        clusters. My most recent research has also used these historical data to study women's labour force
        participation in creative industries.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Urban, Regional, and International Economics (URI)
        at TU
        Dortmund. I
        received a PhD in Economics from Trinity College Dublin (Ireland). I
        was one of the inaugural Grattan Scholars at Trinity College Dublin, and I was selected as an Irish Research
        Council
        Fellow at the 5th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting on Economic Sciences. I received my MSc in Economics and
        MPhil
        in
        International Peace Studies from Trinity College Dublin (Ireland), and a BA in Economics from Hendrix
        College
        (USA).
    <p>I worked as a Research Associate for the Institute of Public Administration (IPA), a recognised college of
        University College Dublin (UCD). In this position, I provided research,
        analytical, and statistical assistance as part of an Independent Secretariat for the Expert Commission on
        the
        Domestic Public Water Services. I also worked as a Research Economist for Indecon Economic Consultants in
        Dublin,
        Ireland, where I contributed to a number of economic impact assessments, policy
        reviews, and other assignments for various government departments and agencies.</p>

            since 1700</a>. Journal of Urban Economics, 2019</h4>
        <p>This paper utilises a unique, purpose-built panel dataset on prominent authors in the UK and Ireland born
            1700–1925 to estimate the productivity gains associated with agglomeration of an industry with few capital
            requirements and no apparent need to cluster geographically. I find the average author experiences
            productivity gains of 11.94% per annum when residing in London, the only major literary cluster – a gain not
            associated with living in any of the minor literary clusters. I find evidence of negative selection with
            respect to productivity, indicating the results are not driven by the self-selection of highly productive
            authors to London. I find heterogeneity of returns to living in London by birth cohort and Impact Index
            quartile (a measure of author quality) and that the cohorts who receive the greatest gains from locating in
            London are those for which there is the strongest evidence of negative selection with respect to
            productivity.</p>

                social connections) and input sharing (proxied by characteristics of co-located but not
                socially-connected authors). This study utilises a unique dataset with information on 370 prominent
                authors in the UK and Ireland born 1700–1925. This paper constructs age-productivity profiles to
                determine the productivity gains associated with knowledge spillovers and input sharing. Individual
                fixed effects are used to control for spatial and group sorting. Input sharing of London-based authors
                affects own-productivity positively through output and negatively through quality. There is evidence
                knowledge spillovers when authors live elsewhere, as the output of co-located social connections has a
                positive effect on own-author productivity.

                The origins of urban clusters in German literature (with Lukas Kuld) <em>In progress</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Large cities and clusters of workers are widely understood to be key factors in creative production. In
                this paper, we trace their empirical beginnings in the location choices made by German literary writers.
                We study yearly data on all 149 writers listed in the Encyclopædia Britannica as German and born between
                1700 and 1899. This time frame includes major economic and political changes, such as the introduction
                of copyright. Writers mirror these changes in their mobility, location, and clustering choices. By the
                end of the 19th Century writers show a strong convergence into few large cities during early adulthood,
                which is not observed for earlier cohorts, and show typical modern life-cycle migration.

                Making the list: Gender representation in literature (with Lukas Kuld) <em>In progress</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Looking at two hundred years of American literature, we compare female participation across different
                types of literature, success criteria, and data sources. Two key observations emerge. First, during the
                Twentieth Century, female writers hve a much higher representation in bestselling lists, at almost
                parity with male writers, than in literary cannons by present-day critics. Second, and similar to other
                socio-economic measures, we see a marked decrease in bestselling books by women during the mid-Twentieth
                Century. The same decrease is not observed for commercially less successful and for critically acclaimed
                publications. This might indicate an increasingly difficult market for female writers but also
                represents a convergence of gender roles for commercially and critically successful publications. In
                addition, by including a large range of data sources and metrics, we should how methodological choices
                can affect estimates on gender representation in the arts.

                Toni Morrison and American literature: Determinants of female literary creativity (with Christiane
                Hellmanzik and Lukas Kuld) <em>In progress</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
                This paper investigates differences between female and male productivity in literary production using a
                novel dataset of eminent American writers of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Using yearly data on
                publications, critical acclaim information, as well as market success data and residency of 472 American
                writers, we show that differences between male and female literary productivity were not as large as
                expected and that career profiles over time are relatively similar when controlling for other factors.
                This is different from what we observe in other occupations, historically and contemporaneously.
                Moreover, we use information on trading laws in the US and exploit variation between states to test
                whether control and ownership over their works impacted female literary careers. Preliminary evidence
                suggests that this is indeed the case. One explanation is that economic incentives granted through legal
                autonomy spur women on to engage in creative activity.

        <h3>Economics of Migration</h3>
        <p>I lectured the Economics of Migration seminar offered by the Chair of Urban, Regional, and International
            Economics at
            TU Dortmund in Autumn 2018 and Autumn 2019. This seminar was taught to 25-30 final year bachelor students
            and masters
            students
            in
            the
            Department of Economics and the Department of Spatial Planning. The seminar was also open to students from
            several
            other faculties, such as industrial engineering and computer science. </p>
        <p>The aim of this seminar was to explore the causes and effects of migration from a microeconomic and
            macroeconomic
            perspective and evaluate current economic policy debates from a scientific perspective. The Economics of
            Migration
            seminar
            lectures presented a series of economic research papers that broadly examine the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who migrates?</li>
            <li>How do immigrants do in the labour market relative to natives?</li>
            <li>What impact do immigrants have on natives (wages, innovation)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The rest of the seminar was designed to promote the discussion of scientific issues, active student
            participation in discussions, and intensive self-study. Students were required to work in groups to select a
            research topic
            related to migration, conduct an empirical analysis, and present their findings through an oral presentation
            and
            written report.</p>
