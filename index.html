    <p>I am an empirical economist with research interests in urban economics, labour economics, economic history, and
        cultural economics.
        My research has touched on several subfields of economics, including migration, agglomeration of economics
        activity, and the economic history of the arts. I use novel, historical datasets to study the migration and
        geographic clustering of creative workers and to identify agglomeration effects associated with artistic
        clusters. My most recent research has also used these historical data to study gender and racial gaps in
        literature.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Urban, Regional, and International Economics (URI) at TU
        Dortmund. I received a PhD in Economics from Trinity College Dublin (Ireland). I was one of the inaugural
        Grattan Scholars at Trinity College Dublin, and I was selected as an Irish Research Council Fellow at the 5th
        Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting on Economic Sciences. I received my MSc in Economics and MPhil in International
        Peace Studies from Trinity College Dublin (Ireland), and a BA in Economics from Hendrix College (USA).
    <p>I worked as a Research Associate for the Institute of Public Administration (IPA), a recognised college of
        University College Dublin (UCD). In this position, I provided research, analytical, and statistical assistance
        as part of an Independent Secretariat for the Expert Commission on the Domestic Public Water Services. I also
        worked as a Research Economist for Indecon Economic Consultants in Dublin, Ireland, where I contributed to a
        number of economic impact assessments, policy reviews, and other assignments for various government departments
        and agencies.</p>

    <h1>Research</h1>

    <h2 class="anchor" id="Research Overview">Research Overview</h2>
    <p>I am an empirical economist with research interests in urban economics, labour economics, economic history, and
        cultural economics.
        My
        research has touched on several subfields of economics, including migration, agglomeration of economic
        activity, and economic history of the arts. I use novel, historical datasets to study the migration and
        geographic
        clustering of creative workers and to identify agglomeration effects associated with artistic clusters.
        This work has involved extensive data collection, including the collection of automatically extracted
        data from structured data sources and the manual transcription of richer biographical information from
        unstructured
        data into a structured
        database.</p>
    <p>My current research addresses the rise and decline of literary clusters, the migration of authors,
        patterns of agglomeration and co-agglomeration in creative industries, market forces in the development of
        literary clusters, individual life-cycle productivity of authors, and gender and racial gaps in authorship. I
        utilises data on individual authors spanning more than 200
        years, allowing me the understand how historical events impact the life-cycle productivity of individual
        innovative agents. My research indicates that writers were extremely mobile relative
        to the general population, and that birth location and death location play a marginal role in lifetime
        productivity. Thus, the use of detailed lifetime information provides important insights into the circumstances
        of idea creation for those engaged in innovative and creative industries.</p>
    <p>This work takes on increasing relevance in the current environment where traditional channels enabling knowledge
        spillovers, such as repeated face-to-face interaction, are limited. In the current situation, traditional
        literary salons cannot operate and artists are forced to explore new avenues for collaboration. Historical
        research on
        the impact of co-location and barriers to social interaction, such as war or the 1918 Flu Pandemic, on
        productivity
        may provide insights into how the current pandemic will impact creative and innovative production.

    <h4><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2019.05.002">London calling? Agglomeration economies in literature
        since 1700</a>. Journal of Urban Economics, 2019</h4>
    <p>This paper utilises a unique, purpose-built panel dataset on prominent authors in the UK and Ireland born
        1700–1925 to estimate the productivity gains associated with agglomeration of an industry with few capital
        requirements and no apparent need to cluster geographically. I find the average author experiences
        productivity gains of 11.94% per annum when residing in London, the only major literary cluster – a gain not
        associated with living in any of the minor literary clusters. I find evidence of negative selection with
        respect to productivity, indicating the results are not driven by the self-selection of highly productive
        authors to London. I find heterogeneity of returns to living in London by birth cohort and Impact Index
        quartile (a measure of author quality) and that the cohorts who receive the greatest gains from locating in
        London are those for which there is the strongest evidence of negative selection with respect to
        productivity.</p>

        Localisation effects in literature: Peer quantity, quality, or productivity?
        <a href="img/Mitchell_WorkingPaper_Dec2020.pdf" download="SaraMitchell_JobMarketPaper2020.pdf">
            <em>Working Paper</em>
        </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
        This paper utilises a unique dataset on 369 prominent authors in the UK and Ireland from 1725-1975 to provides
        evidence of on localisation effects (the number of authors in a given location) and urbanisation effects (the
        general urban environment). This paper also tests whether localisation effects occur through a quality channel
        (the quality of co-located authors), a quantity channel (the number of co-located authors), or a productivity
        channel (the output of co-located authors). It also uses data on author social connections to disentangle the
        effects of co-located social connections and the effects of other authors living in the same city. The results
        suggests that the localisation of authors in London results in a `crowding out' effects, while London
        urbanisation effects have a positive impact on own-productivity. The localisation effects occur primarily
        through quality and productivity channels, and these effects occur through the general clustering of authors and
        not through co-located social connections. There is also evidence that authors benefit most from localisation
        effects when they are under the age of 40 and thus in the early stages of their career.

        Manhattan Transfer: Agglomeration and productivity in American literary production (with Lukas Kuld and
        Christiane Hellmanzik) <em>In progress</em>
    </h4>
    <p>
        New York City has dominated American literary production for almost 150 years. In this paper, we show strong
        agglomeration effects for authors residing in New York City during the industry's infancy before World War II.
        The effect declines with industry maturity and technological progress in communication and printing. We combine
        novel yearly data on publications and residency of 471 eminent authors with US census data to provide a complete
        picture of industry concentration and agglomeration effects since 1850. Taking relocation of working-age authors
        to New York City as an event study, we see an immediate increase in publications after arriving. However, the
        publication frequency of novels and nowadays successful works rises only gradually over the ten years following
        arrival in NYC.

    <h4>
        The origins of urban clusters in German literature (with Lukas Kuld) <em>In progress</em>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Large cities and clusters of workers are widely understood to be key factors in creative production. In
        this paper, we trace their empirical beginnings in the location choices made by German literary writers.
        We study yearly data on all 149 writers listed in the Encyclopædia Britannica as German and born between
        1700 and 1899. This time frame includes major economic and political changes, such as the introduction
        of copyright. Writers mirror these changes in their mobility, location, and clustering choices. By the
        end of the 19th Century writers show a strong convergence into few large cities during early adulthood,
        which is not observed for earlier cohorts, and show typical modern life-cycle migration.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Making the list: Gender representation in literature (with Lukas Kuld) <em>In progress</em>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Looking at two hundred years of American literature, we compare female participation across different
        types of literature, success criteria, and data sources. Two key observations emerge. First, during the
        Twentieth Century, female writers hve a much higher representation in bestselling lists, at almost
        parity with male writers, than in literary cannons by present-day critics. Second, and similar to other
        socio-economic measures, we see a marked decrease in bestselling books by women during the mid-Twentieth
        Century. The same decrease is not observed for commercially less successful and for critically acclaimed
        publications. This might indicate an increasingly difficult market for female writers but also
        represents a convergence of gender roles for commercially and critically successful publications. In
        addition, by including a large range of data sources and metrics, we should how methodological choices
        can affect estimates on gender representation in the arts.

        Toni Morrison and American literature: Determinants of female literary creativity (with Christiane

    </h4>
    <p>
        This paper investigates differences between female and male productivity in literary production using a
        novel dataset of eminent American writers of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Using yearly data on
        publications, critical acclaim information, as well as market success data and residency of 472 American
        writers, we show that differences between male and female literary productivity were not as large as
        expected and that career profiles over time are relatively similar when controlling for other factors.
        This is different from what we observe in other occupations, historically and contemporaneously.
        Moreover, we use information on trading laws in the US and exploit variation between states to test
        whether control and ownership over their works impacted female literary careers. Preliminary evidence
        suggests that this is indeed the case. One explanation is that economic incentives granted through legal
        autonomy spur women on to engage in creative activity.

    <h1>Teaching</h1>

    <a class="anchor" id="Teaching Overview"><h2>Teaching Overview</h2></a>

    <p>I have a broad range of experience teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate level, ranging from teaching
        core economic theory, math, and statistics courses to undergraduate students to teaching applied microeconomics
        seminars to graduate students.</p>
    <p>During the first year of my PhD at Trinity College Dublin, I was nominated for two teaching awards for my work as
        a
        teaching assistant for the first year undergraduate <em>Mathematics and Statistics</em> course. I was the
        lecturer
        of the mathematics section of this course for the next three years. I also served as a teaching assistant for
        the
        second year undergraduate <em>Intermediate Microeconomics</em> course and as a teaching assistant and lecturer
        for
        the <em>Economic Policy and Analysis II</em> course in the Masters in Development Practice programme.</p>
    <p>As a postdoc at TU Dortmund, I have taught courses and seminars on labour economics (including migration and
        human
        capital), urban economics, academic writing, and more recently, European economic integration and Brexit. In
        addition to teaching, I also have experience in thesis supervision: BSc Economics (4); MSc Economics (4); MSc
        Business Mathematics (1).</p>

    <h3>Economics of Migration</h3>
    <p>I lectured the Economics of Migration seminar offered by the Chair of Urban, Regional, and International
        Economics at TU Dortmund in Autumn 2018 and Autumn 2019. This seminar was taught to 25-30 final year bachelor
        students and masters students in the Department of Economics and the Department of Spatial Planning. The seminar
        was also open to students from several other faculties, such as industrial engineering and computer
        science. </p>
    <p>The aim of this seminar was to explore the causes and effects of migration from a microeconomic and
        macroeconomic perspective and evaluate current economic policy debates from a scientific perspective. The
        Economics of Migration seminar lectures presented a series of economic research papers that broadly examine the
        following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who migrates?</li>
        <li>How do immigrants do in the labour market relative to natives?</li>
        <li>What impact do immigrants have on natives (wages, innovation)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The rest of the seminar was designed to promote the discussion of scientific issues, active student
        participation in discussions, and intensive self-study. Students were required to work in groups to select a
        research topic
        related to migration, conduct an empirical analysis, and present their findings through an oral presentation
        and
        written report.</p>

    <h3>Human Capital and the Knowledge Economy</h3>
    <p>I was a teaching assistant for the Human Capital and the Knowledge Economy course offered by the Chair of Urban,
        Regional, and International Economics at TU Dormtund in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. This course is normally
        taught
        to approx. 60-80 bachelor students in the Department of Economics.
    <p>This course discusses the role of knowledge and education in the careers of individuals and for the economy as a
        whole. The lectures introduced the students to theoretical models and empirical evidence, while the tutorials
        provided
        practice exercises for the theoretical models and applied econometrics examples. For example, the practice
        exercises
        included questions on the Becker and Spence models, questions on how various empirical approaches address the
        issue of ability bias, and questions on how to interpret the output of Mincer earnings regressions.</p>

    <h3>Economics of Brexit</h3>
    <p>I lectured the Economics of Brexit seminar offered by the Chair of Urban, Regional, and International Economics
        at
        TU Dortmund in Spring 2020. This seminar was taught to approx. 20 final year bachelor students and masters
        students
        in the Department of Economics and the Department of Spatial Planning. The seminar was also
        open to students from several other faculties, such as industrial engineering and computer science.</p>
    <p>This seminar aims to build on students’ prior knowledge of international trade, factor market integration, tariff
        policy, and regional competition and industrial policy. Students will apply this knowledge to a practical,
        real-world example – Brexit. In this setting, students will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gain a deeper understanding of complex trade interdependencies between EU and other countries;
        </li>
        <li>
            Learn about the economic framework of decision-making within the EU, particularly with respect to how EU
            trade
            policies are set within the EU and between EU and other countries;
        </li>
        <li>
            Explore the European Union’s legal framework and legislative process with respect to developing trade
            policies;
        </li>
        <li>
            Learn how to evaluate current economic policy debates by synthesizing country-specific trade policy and data
            and
            producing a policy report from that country’s perspective.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The first half of the course involves lectures on the history of European economic integration. These lectures
        provide an overview of the history of the European Union, EU institutions and decision-making processes before
        discussing the microeconomics and macroeconomics of European integration. Topics covered include: preferential
        trade
        liberalisation, customs union vs free trade agreement, types of barriers to trade, allocation and growth effects
        of
        trade liberalisation, effect of trade liberalisation on labour markets and migration, exchange rates, optimum
        currency areas, monetary integration, fiscal policy, and the effect of the global financial crisis. This seminar
        discussed EU policies such as Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), EU structural funds and cohesion policy, EU
        competition and state aid, and the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
    <p>In the second week, students are allocated into groups and assigned an EU member state, and the students are
        required to research that country's economic relationship with the UK and how it will likely be affected by
        Brexit.
        During the second half of the course, the students present their country's position to the class and engage in
        simulated Brexit negotiations. The assessments include two shorter summary reports submitted before and after
        the
        negotiation process and a longer research paper submitted at the end of the course.</p>
    <p>Reading list:</p>

    <h3>Academic Writing</h3>
    <p>I lectured the Academic Writing course offered by the Chair of Urban, Regional, and International
        Economics at
        TU Dortmund in Spring 2019. This course is taught to a small group of no more than 20 students. The course
        was open to students
        participating in
        the SPRING Masters Programme offered by the Department of Spatial Planning, and it was also open to bachelor
        students
        participating in the Digitalisation seminar (offered at the URI chair) who needed to fulfil their Modul 11:
        Wissenschafliches Arbeiten requirement.</p>
    <p>During this course, students learn how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Structure ideas in academic writing: academic writing as ‘storytelling’
        </li>
        <li>
            Understand the various types of writing and how this affects style, vocabulary and content
        </li>
        <li>
            Discuss research in appropriate language for various audiences (scholarly and general)
        </li>
        <li>
            Critique academic writing and how to respond to academic criticism (providing suggestions, accepting
            suggestions, defending decisions)
        </li>
        <li>
            Present qualitative and quantitative analyses in a way that is meaningful and accessible
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing concisely, accurately, and accessibly to communicate complex ideas
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Relevant high-quality sources on academic citations/referencing, writing style guides, guides to presenting
        statistics, etc. are provided.</p>

    <h3>Mathematics and Statistics</h3>
    <p>I lectured the Mathematics section of the Mathematics and Statistics module offered by the Department of
        Economics in
        Trinity
        College Dublin in Autumn 2013, Autumn 2014, and Spring 2016. The module was taught to 375-400 first year
        bachelor
        students studying business,
        economics, and other social sciences in the School of Social Sciences and Philosophy. The 2 weekly lectures
        were
        supplemented with weekly tutorials (~20 students per tutorial) taught by 4-5 teaching assistants.</p>
    <p>The content of the mathematics section of the module included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear and quadratic functions</li>

    <h2>More about me</h2>

    In my free time, I enjoy learning about history, languages, and web design. I developed this website using CSS and
    HTML (although I had help with the Javascript to collapse the navigation bar), and I manage the design and
    content of the URI Chair website. I also enjoy learning more about the language, history, and culture of my
    husband's
    country - Portugal. I started taking Portuguese language classes at the Portuguese Language Centre in Dublin in
    2016,
    and I have been learning primarily through self-study since moving to Dortmund. During our holidays, my husband and
    I
    enjoy exploring the gastronomy and culture of Portugal. You can see some photos from our Portuguese adventures
